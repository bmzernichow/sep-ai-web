                "definition": "This category encompasses methods that are concerned with black-box pretrained machine learning models. More specifically, such methods do not try to create interpretable models, but, instead, try to interpret already trained, often complex models. That is also why they sometimes are referred to as post-hoc interpretability methods in the related scientific literature. Under this taxonomy, this category, due to the volume of scientific work around deep learning related interpretability methodologies, is split into two sub-categories, one specifically for deep learning methods and one concerning all other black-box models."
